# Information Retrieval - Wikipedia tf-idf
 Code written as part of the course "Search Engines and Recommender Systems" - Ariel University. 
 
 Focus on Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency - showing the highest weighted terms in a Wikipedia page using a corpus of Wikpedia terms with given IDFs. This in order to get a general idea about a given Wiki page.  
 
 Final result is a Wordcloud like such (try figuring out the Wiki page... ðŸ˜œ)
